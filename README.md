Agent skills for Vue 3 development.

> 🚧 **Early Experiment**
>
> This repository is an early experiment in creating specialized skills for AI agents to enhance their capabilities in Vue 3 development. The skills are derived from real-world issues and best practices, but might be incomplete or inaccurate due to hallucinations.
>
> Please give feedback when encountering any issues.


## Installation

```bash
npx add-skill hyf0/vue-skills

## Rule Types

Rules are classified into two categories:

- **Capability**: AI *cannot* solve the problem without the skill. These address version-specific issues, undocumented behaviors, recent features, or edge cases outside AI's training data.

- **Efficiency**: AI *can* solve the problem but not well. These provide optimal patterns, best practices, and consistent approaches that improve solution quality.

## Methodology

Every skill in this repository is created through a rigorous, evidence-based process:

**1. Real-World Issue Collection**

Skills are sourced from actual developer pain points encountered in production.

**2. Multi-Model Verification**

Each skill undergoes systematic testing:
- **Baseline test**: Verify the model fails to solve the problem *without* the skill
- **Skill test**: Confirm the model correctly solves the problem *with* the skill
- **Consistency test**: Run multiple times to ensure reliable behavior

**3. Model Tier Validation**

Skills are tested across model capabilities:

| Model | Without Skill | With Skill | Requirement |
|-------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Haiku | Expected: Fail | Pass | Skill kept |
| Sonnet | Expected: Fail | Pass | Skill kept |
| Opus | May pass | Should pass | Reference |

**Acceptance criteria**: A skill is only kept if it enables Haiku or Sonnet to solve a problem they couldn't solve without it.
