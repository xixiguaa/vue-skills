Provides an `execute` function to trigger the async operation\n4. Automatically handles loading state (true while executing, false when done)\n5. Captures any errors that occur during execution\n6. Can be called with `immediate: true` option to execute immediately\n\nExample usage:\n```ts\nconst { data, loading, error, execute } = useAsync(fetchUser, { immediate: true })\n```",
