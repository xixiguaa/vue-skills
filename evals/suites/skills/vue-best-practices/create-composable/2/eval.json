Returns a new ref that updates only after the delay has passed since the last change\n3. Cancels pending updates when the source value changes\n4. Provides a `flush` function to immediately apply pending value\n5. Cleans up timers when the component unmounts\n\nExample usage:\n```ts\nconst searchQuery = ref('')\nconst debouncedQuery = useDebounce(searchQuery, 300)\n```",
